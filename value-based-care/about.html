      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <div class="multi-col">
        <p>
          The purpose of this project is to explore how value-based care (VBC) is reshaping modern healthcare delivery. 
          Instead of rewarding volume, VBC ties compensation to patient outcomes, prevention, and long-term wellness. 
          This shift represents a philosophical and practical transformation — encouraging healthcare providers to see patients not as individual visits, but as continuous stories of health. 
          The project aims to make this concept accessible by examining how VBC can build more efficient, compassionate, and equitable systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          By comparing the structures of the United States and United Kingdom healthcare systems, the project highlights both the promise and the obstacles of implementing value-based models. 
          It shows how coordinated, preventive care can improve outcomes while containing costs — and how policy, data, and innovation must align to sustain change. 
          Ultimately, the goal is to engage readers in understanding that quality care depends on relationships, equity, and the shared pursuit of health, not just clinical performance.

      <h3>Design and Approach</h3>
      <div class="multi-col">
        <p>
          The design of this site reflects the same values that define effective healthcare: clarity, accessibility, and integration. 
          Each page uses a grid-based structure that adapts seamlessly across screen sizes, ensuring that the experience remains consistent and readable on both mobile and desktop devices. 
          The layout encourages exploration — guiding visitors from core ideas to supporting data and resources — just as patient-centered care guides individuals through their unique health journeys.
        </p>

        <p>
          Visually, the color palette and typography were chosen for simplicity and legibility, avoiding distraction while emphasizing structure and trust. 
          Responsive images and flexible layouts mirror the adaptability healthcare systems must achieve in practice. 
          Every design choice — from the balanced columns to the structured navigation — reinforces the message that clarity and care go hand in hand. 
          This combination of academic depth and accessible design creates a space where information feels both authoritative and humane.
